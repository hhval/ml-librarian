# ML Librarian
Skillfully applying AI is becoming increasingly important in many jobs, and the field of machine learning and generative AI is growing by leaps and bounds every day. Luckily there are many free or affordable ways to learn online, and on this site I share easily accessible ML/AI learning resources that can help people from many different backgrounds increase their AI literacy.
